# RhovasX

RhovasX is an e**X**perimental version of Rhovas created to test the limits of a
language's innovation budget for the [Repl.it LangJam](https://repl.it/langjam).
The primary concepts being explored are:

 - Compiler options, directives, and embedded DSLs
 - Inheritance model with classes, structs, and interfaces
 - Error handling with exceptions and result types
 - API system (contracts, modules, & dependencies)

To stay up to date on progress, please join our
[Discord](https://discord.gg/gm96xd8) and say hello in the `rhovas-x` channel!

### Development Stream

Development of RhovasX for the LangJam is being streamed daily on Twitch. I'm
moving at a fast pace, but I'll be doing the best I can to clearly explain each
step and answer any questions along the way.
